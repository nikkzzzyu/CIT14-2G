            "The Villanueva family is comparable to a strong thread that binds together courage, love, 
            and our beloved traditions. Similar to how an artwork is made up of distinct, separate 
            pieces, our family, with its variety of people and stories, joins together 
            to forge a stunning work of art that embodies our fortitude, unity, 
            and strong spirit as the Villanueva family."
